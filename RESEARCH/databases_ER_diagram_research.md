# Research Report
## MySQL, Databases and ER diagrams
### Summary of Work
I researched how to create an ER diagram for databases. I also followed a tutorial on how to convert schema in MySQL to an ER diagram. By following this tutorial I created an ER diagram that shows how our database design will look.
### Motivation
Our project will use a database from which information will be extracted regarding login information, leaderboard and basic in game data. It will run on a CSL VM and will provide a restful API for the backend and frontend. To create this, I needed to learn the basics of MySQL and relational databases so I could create an ER diagram and design the database so that it can be usable for our application.
### Time Spent
~30 minutes researching basic databases and MySQL syntax.
~30 minutes installing MySQL workbench.
~30 minutes following the tutorial
### Results
I started by reading through the basic functions of MySQL building databases at W3 schools website. 
I then found a guide on how to convert a MySQL database to an ER diagram using the MySQL workbench application. I went on to install this application and do some further research on relational database design and primary and foreign key functionalities.
